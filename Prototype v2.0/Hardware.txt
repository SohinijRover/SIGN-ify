MCU(Micro Controller Unit) - To be decided based on finalized components
Best options: ARM Cortex M4
PCB:
>BLE module embedded (communication with app)
>Micro Speaker embedded
>Micro-Processor
>Cut out in centre for MPU 6050
>Shunt resistors with male pins (for flex connector) (if possible, micro potentiometers)
Sensors:
1. Flex Sensor (2.2 inches) - #7 ~ 5 fingers + 2 backups
2. MPU6050 - Gyroscope/Accelerometer/Digital Motion Processor (DMP) 6-axis Motion Sensor with I2C/SPI Interface (uses 3.3v so easy to implement with ESP32) 
3. SparkFun Triple Axis Accelerometer Breakout â€“ ADXL337 - 3 Axis finger position
Glove:  Customized glove with adjustable strap and fingertip cuts: <=Rs. 2000(Vendor pricing)
Power Supply: 
1. Rechargable Li-ion (based on sensors to power)
2. Wireless charging (OPTIONAL)
